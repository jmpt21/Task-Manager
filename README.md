## For developers

1. Run `node server.js` to launch the server (express) and the built angular application, stored in the `dist/` directory.
2. If you want to do a change in the project, always run `ng build` before `node server.js`.
3. If you want to do a change in the server, see `server/` directory.
4. This is a practice simple project. I am proud of myself :), and I am aware that the project can improve.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
